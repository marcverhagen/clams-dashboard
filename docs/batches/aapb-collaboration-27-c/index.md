#### Batch comment

This batch contains 20 handpicked videos for scene recognition with variability
in slates, chyrons and credits. It was originally intended for dense time point
labeling for the Scene Recognition application (similar to an earlier batch named
aapb-collaboration-27-a).


See https://github.com/clamsproject/aapb-collaboration/issues/27 for the issue
on time frame detection that motivated this batch and related batches.
