#### Batch comment

Originally, a set of about 4000 videos was selected for slate annotation. This
batch has the GUIDs that were not include in batch aapb-collaboration-7, which
contains the GUIDs of assets that were annotated.


See https://github.com/clamsproject/aapb-collaboration/issues/79 for more info.


Note that the issue identifier on this batch does not match the related issue,
probably due to a human error somewhere in the loop.
